# Magento 2 Naver Login Extension

[Naver Login Magento 2 extension](https://plumrocket.com/magento-social-login-pro/naver-login) by Plumrocket makes it easy for your customers to sign up and sign in to your website using their existing Naver account. It creates a seamless and frictionless experience for your customers and lets them access your website securely, at any time, from any device – all with the click of a button.

## How it works
 
The extension displays the Login with Naver button on all login and registrations forms. By clicking on it, users only need to provide their existing Naver account login and password to authenticate to your website. You can enable the button to be displayed on certain or all pages across the store. Additionally, the extension has the following benefits:

* When logging in with Naver, the extension automatically retrieves profile data from the accounts, including email, birth date, gender, user photo, etc., so you can run more accurate marketing campaigns and launch targeted promotions.
* Display your customers’ profile photos anywhere on your website. It's a great way to give them a more personalized experience.
* Help your customers spread the word by sharing your website with friends on social media, and therefore increase your social traffic.
* Increase the number of orders placed by enabling the Naver Login button on the checkout page. First-time users will be more likely to buy without registering an account.
 
With this extension, you will simplify and speed up the sign-in & sign-up process while keeping it secure, encouraging customers, increasing sales and account registrations!
